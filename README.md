# Dog Breed Classifier

Classify dog breeds from images using PyTorch models. Includes a Streamlit web app for easy image upload and instant predictions.

---

## Features
- Upload an image and get the predicted dog breed instantly
- Choose between ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG pre-trained models
- Powered by PyTorch and Streamlit
- Easily extensible for other image classification tasks

---

## Demo
Run locally and open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` to use the web app.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
